## Project Summary


## Utilized Technologies
Below is a list of technologies that we used to create our application.
* Primary Language: [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* Framework: [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* Front-End CSS: [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/) & [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/)
* Back-End: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

We also utilized icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) and bootstrapped the application using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

## Reasoning
### Project Inspiration
### Tech Choices
We chose to use React as it was a language both of us knew, with JavaScript at its core. MaterializeCSS and Material-UI were relatively new front-end frameworks, but we wanted to experiment with them and incorporate their functionality and design into our application. We merged the material design with our own CSS style to create a unique face to our app. Firebase was chosen as the backend since it is free, easy to use, well-documented and included quick and dirty hosting.
