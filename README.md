## Project Summary
Frontier is a platform that enables job seekers to create brilliant portfolio project that companies actually care to see. Many students donâ€™t have full-time positions immediately following graduation. Our desire is to remove that divide. Frontier provides company sponsored projects that enable candidates to improve their resumes through project completion, as well as secure offers in their fields of interest. Companies will be able to follow up on brilliantly done submissions, and reach out to individuals they wish to hire. No other application has sought to solve this problem in this way. We are the first of our kind in the massive market of recruitment/staffing, and we plan on generating the bridge to connect brilliant candidates to brilliant companies.

## Product Steps
### 1. Finding a project
When a new job seeker enters the site, they are able to filter down from hundreds of projects to find the one they'd be most interested in doing and succeeding in. We filter by difficulty, profession, interested companies, and more.

### 2. Crafting the project
Once a user decides to do a project, we supply them with the resources and information for them to create the best work they can.

### 3. Submitting & Employer Interest
Once the user is done, they can submit their project to Frontier, where we will then send the projects to the appropiate interested companies. If the company likes the submission quality, Frontier connects the two parties.

## Utilized Technologies
Below is a list of technologies that we used to create our application.
* Primary Language: [JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com/)
* Framework: [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* Front-End CSS: [MaterializeCSS](http://materializecss.com/) & [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com/#/)
* Back-End: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

We also utilized icons from [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) and bootstrapped the application using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)

## Reasoning
### Project Inspiration
The inspiration for Frontier came from the realization of two phenomenon. First, we know for a fact for that if given two candidates of equal strength, if one candidate has a project that more closely relates to the functions/industry of the employer, that candidate has a higher chance of getting an offer over the other. But what is a "compelling" portfolio project is oqaque to the job seeker. The second phenomenon is that there people who ARE good candidates, but don't LOOK like good candidates. This is a large group of talent that companies are missing because of their screening process. We wanted to address both these phenomenons by bringing transperancy to what companies are looking for as well as helping talent show themselves in a better way.

### Tech Choices
We chose to use React as it was a language both of us knew, with JavaScript at its core. MaterializeCSS and Material-UI were relatively new front-end frameworks, but we wanted to experiment with them and incorporate their functionality and design into our application. We merged the material design with our own CSS style to create a unique face to our app. Firebase was chosen as the backend since it is free, easy to use, well-documented and included quick and dirty hosting.
